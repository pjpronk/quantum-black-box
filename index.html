            <h2>               
            The Quantum Black Box is a small square box, approximately 5cm in height and width, featuring walls with a thickness of 1nm. Within this confined space resides a solitary electron. The probability of this electron tunneling through the 1nm wall is approximately 1 in 1-e5. Given enough time and iterations the electron will be open the black box without the need to interact with it. 
            </h2>

            <h2> However, by pressing the white dot above, you can forcefully open the black box, liberating the electron. The consequences of unlocking the black box are unknown.</h2>
